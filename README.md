# Multiple Choice Exam Grading Program

This C++ program grades a multiple-choice exam consisting of 5 questions and provides feedback on the most frequently missed questions. It involves three phases: initializing questions, conducting the quiz for 5 students, and displaying the results.

## Project Overview

### Phase 1: Question and Answer Initialization

- The program initializes 5 different questions along with their respective choices and correct answers.
- Each question ends with a question mark (`?`), and each choice ends with a dot (`.`).
- Correct answers are stored in a separate array.

### Phase 2: Conduct the Quiz

- The quiz is taken by 5 students in parallel.
- The program asks for student IDs and then presents the questions along with their choices.
- Students provide their answers, which are recorded in arrays.

### Phase 3: Display Results

- The program displays the answers provided by each student.
- It shows the answer key and calculates the score for each student.
- It also provides feedback on how many students missed each question.
